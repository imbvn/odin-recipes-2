    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bun Bo Hue is a spicy Vietnamese noodle soup that is absolutely addictive and one of the best noodle soups in the world. Unlike the ubiquitous, well-loved and well-known pho, bun bo hue is strangely not as popular, but those in the know, know: Bun bo hue is where it's at.</p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a small pot of water to the boil and blanch the oxtails for 5 minutes. Bring a second, larger pot with 8 cups of water to a boil. If you are using an instant pot, just add 8 cups of water to the insert.</li>
        <li>Instant Pot directions: add oxtails, lemongrass, shallots, and brisket to the instant pot and cook on high pressure for 45 min, then quick release.<br>Stovetop Directions: Rinse and transfer the oxtails to the second pot along with the lemongrass and shallots. Simmer on low for 3.5 hours. Add the brisket and continue to simmer for another 2 hours for 5.5 hours total. Use a slotted spoon to remove the lemongrass and shallots. Take the oxtail and brisket out and store in a container. Transfer the soup to another container and put everything in the fridge.</li>
        <li>While the soup is simmering, mince the lemongrass for the satế and transfer it to a food processor along with the shallot, garlic, and Thai chilies. Pulse into a fine paste.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the satế paste and fry, stirring, just until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the chili flakes, sugar, fish sauce, and shrimp paste (if using). Let cool then place in a jar or airtight container. The satế will keep in the fridge for up to several weeks.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noodles according to the package directions, usually 10-15 minutes for properly thick vermicelli. Meanwhile, heat up your bowls by filling with hot tap water. In a second saucepan, combine the soup with enough water to make 8 cups then bring to a low simmer. Slice the brisket and place into the soup to reheat, along with the halved meatballs, and sliced ham. When the noodles are done, drain in a colander, and rinse well with cold water and allow 2-3 minutes to dry.</li>
        <li>Drain your bowls, then divide the noodles evenly between the bowls and top the noodles with the brisket, beef balls, and ham. Scoop on 1-2 tablespoons of the satế depending on your taste for saltiness and spiciness - you can always add more later.</li>
        <li>Ladle on the piping hot broth. Enjoy immediately topped with banana blossoms, sliced onions, sawtooth coriander, cilantro, Thai basil, and lime.</li>
    </ol>
